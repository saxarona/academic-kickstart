abstract = "This paper will review the creation of a physical structure with technological components that will allow the student to visualize changes in depth on a real surface in a continuous manner. Using a Kinect for Windows and a projector, it is intended to create a didactic environment involving visual and gestural aspects, aiming for a better comprehension about plots of functions of two real variables as surfaces in space. Colored imagery is projected onto an elastic cloth where the student can create peaks and valleys, allowing them to perceive the relation between colors and depth changes in the surface."
