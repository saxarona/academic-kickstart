abstract = "The Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) “Math and Motion” presents a different way for the interaction with Mathematical knowledge. In this course, digital technologies are integrated during the process of Mathematical teaching. These technologies are mixed with Mathematical contents to create a didactic scenario. In this scenario, numeric, algebraic and graphical representations are incorporated to the real-life context of linear motion. This scenario offers learning with a real meaning for the Mathematics knowledge. Assessment in this new way of interaction with Mathematics considers new challenges besides its online feature. In Math and Motion, lectures are available in weekly videos, and each week includes an assessment of multiple responses items executed in platform COURSERA. In this paper we describe the didactic design of Math and Motion MOOC and its assessment, as well as the findings during its first delivery in fall semester 2013."
