abstract = "The Augmented Reality Application we present here is an educational resource meant to help transform the teaching of Mathematics. It takes advantage of the didactic potential of this emergent technology in order to create graphical representations for mathematical reasoning. We identified the spatial visualization skill as a cross-curriculum content that has been taken for granted, and we took on the task of designing an educational resource to improve the development of this skill. The application involves some topics that belong to conventional courses of Calculus I, II and III at College."
